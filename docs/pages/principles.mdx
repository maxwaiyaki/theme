# Design Principles


Our goal is to design simple, composable components that cater to real life UI
design problems. In order to do that, we developed a set of principles that help
us always be on that path.

- **Efficient:** The least amount of markup and assets are used to achieve the design.

- **Standardized:** Rules for common values are stored and used liberally & universally..

- **Abstracted:** Base elements are separated from a specific context and form a core framework.

- **Modular:** Common elements are logically broken into reusable parts.

- **Configurable:** Customisations to base elements are available through optional parameters.

- **Scalable:** The code is easily extended and anticipates enhancements in the future.
