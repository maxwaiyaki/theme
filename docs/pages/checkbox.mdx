# Checkbox

Checkbox component is used in forms when a user needs to select multiple values
from several options.

Native HTML checkboxes are 100% accessible by default, so we used a
[very common CSS technique](https://dev.to/lkopacz/create-custom-keyboard-accessible-checkboxes-2036)
to style the checkboxes.

The Checkbox component composes [ControlBox](/controlbox), a component we
created to make it easy to style an element based on sibling inputs.
