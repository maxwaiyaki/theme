# Collapse

The Collapse component is used to create regions of content that can
expand/collapse with a simple animation. It helps to hide content that's not
immediately relevant to the user.

This component leverages
[react-animate-height](https://github.com/Stanko/react-animate-height), and
composes the [Box](/box) component.
